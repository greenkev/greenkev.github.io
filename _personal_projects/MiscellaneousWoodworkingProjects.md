This was a cutting board I made for a friend. The half block offsetting pattern turned out pretty neat.

Another cutting board I made for a friend using maple and walnut. There is a subtle brick pattern on the interior.

This was a cutting board I made for my mother. She said she didn't care about the pattern, so I took that as a personal challenge to do something a little ridiculous. The bricks are maple and the grout is walnut. But importantly all the wood is end grain, including the long thin sections of grout.

This was a practice project in making a small box using finger joints cut using a jig on a tablesaw. It is designed to hold my router corner rounding jig.

A set of coasters made with walnut, maple, and santos mahogany. I have no idea if this is a "real" mahogany. I think it is not, but the definition of mahogany is shocking complex and illogical.

A hickory shop stool. I specifically designed this with 3 legs so that on my uneven shop floor it wouldn't rock. This was my experiment working with hickory, which is an ridiculously hard, tough, and splintery wood. Great for axe handles, please don't use it for furniture.

One day I came across some of Muybridge's "Animal Locomotion" scans on a public domain database and was reminded of some of my literature reviews during grad school. 
I thought it would be a really nice piece of wall art for my home office to have a trio of plantigrade running, digitigrade running, and quadruped galloping. So I dug through the versions I could find, did some minor edits for arragement and exposure, and got them printed. 
I then made a set of mortise and tenon picture frames for them.

I added a DIY wagon vice to the end of my workbench with a maple vise block. I roughly followed [these plans](https://jayscustomcreations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/wagon-vise-diagrams-v2.pdf), but using some threaded rod, nuts, and washers from home depot.
This actually worked out really well, the only issue is that vices are always made with left handed threads so that turning the handle clockwise drives the vice closed. 
Mine is off the shelf right hand thread 3/4-10 rod so my vice is "lefty-tighty, righty-loosy"
