I always found photography interesting, but I got more into it around 2021 when I bought an older model, crop frame sony mirrorless camera.
For being so inexpensive, it has really impressive capabilities and I have learned a lot of about the technical side of photography practicing with it.
I tend to add photography in with my other activities, like going hiking in Oregon, attending auto races, or traveling.

A few of native oregon birds I photographed in portland and the bend area.
