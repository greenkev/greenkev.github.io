I am a roboticist who is fascinated by planning and control for agile legged robots.
I'm particularly excited about the intersection of RL control for locomotion, model-based trajectory optimization, and whole body compliant interaction with the world.

Professionally, I work as a software engineer at [Agility Robotics](https://agilityrobotics.com/) on locomotion for the Digit robot.
In my role at agility I work on both model-based locomotion motion planning and RL locomotion control policies.
Some of the projects I worked on include leading an effort to rebuild a reduced order model based locomotion motion planner, development of RL step recovery controllers, migration of locomotion control logic into a behavior tree, development of learned general purpose RL locomotion control policies, and bringing up locomotion on two new major hardware revisions on a tight timeline.

I received my Robotics PhD from Oregon State University in 2022, advised by Dr. Jonathan Hurst and Dr. Ross L. Hatton. 
At Oregon state I was a member of the [Dynamic Robotics Lab](https://mime.oregonstate.edu/research/drl/) where I studied modeling, control and motion planning as applied to legged robots. 
My research generally focused on methods to combine the power of deep learning, observed principles of legged locomotion from biologists and knowledge of the physics of locomotion.

During my undergrad I worked as a research assistant in Dr. C. David Remy's RAMlab (Robotics and Motion Laboratory) where I worked with RAMone, a series elastic planar biped designed to study efficient locomotion. I also worked as a research assistant in the University of Michigan Medical School's Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.

More information of my current and previous work can be found on the professional projects page.

Outside of work I really enjoy woodworking (check out my projects in the personal projects section), weight lifting, attending concerts, cooking, watching and attending sports, camping, and playing a variety of video games (e.g. Elden Ring, Fallout, Factorio).
