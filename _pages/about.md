I am a PhD student in Robotics at Oregon State University, advised by Jonathan Hurst and Ross L. Hatton. I am a member of the [Dynamic Robotics Lab](https://mime.oregonstate.edu/research/drl/) where I study the modeling, control and motion planning as applied to legged robots. My research focuses on robust and agile bipdal locomotion, particularly applied to Agility Robotics' Cassie Robot.

I am originally from Stevensville Michigan. I received my B.S.E in Mechanical Engineering, Summa Cum Laude, from the University of Michigan in 2017.
