I am a roboticist who is fascinated by planning and control for agile legged robots.
Professionally, I work as a software engineer at [Agility Robotics](https://agilityrobotics.com/) on locomotion motion planning for the Digit robot.

I earned my Robotics PhD at Oregon State University, advised by [Dr. Jonathan Hurst](https://mime.oregonstate.edu/people/hurst) and [Dr. Ross L. Hatton](http://www.rosslhatton.com/). 
At Oregon state I was a member of the [Dynamic Robotics Lab](https://mime.oregonstate.edu/research/drl/) where I studied modeling, control and motion planning as applied to legged robots. 
My research generally focused on methods to combine the power of deep learning, observed principles of legged locomotion from biologists and knowledge of the physics of locomotion.

During my undergrad I worked as a research assistant in [Dr. C. David Remy's](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/press/experts/Prof.-Dr.-C.-David-Remy) RAMlab (Robotics and Motion Laboratory) where I worked with RAMone, a series elastic planar biped designed to study efficient locomotion.

I also worked as a research assistant in a lab group lead by [Dr. Glenn Green, M.D.,](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/otolaryngology/glenn-e-green-md) and [Dr. David Zopf, M.D.,](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/otolaryngology/david-zopf-md-ms) in the University of Michigan Medical School's Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.
In this research I primarily worked on creation of patient specific surgical reference models and high fidelity surgical training models for pediatric procedures. 
Some of the models I contributed to are now sold through a University of Michigan startup, [Make Medical](https://www.makemedical.net/).

I am originally from Saint Joseph, Michigan. 
I received my B.S.E in Mechanical Engineering, Summa Cum Laude, from the University of Michigan in 2017.
Outside of academic research labs, I interned at Whirlpool Corp. and [Jenesis International](https://www.jenesisinc.com/).
At Whirlpool I worked in Computer-Aided Engineering performing test analysis and model correlation on vertical axis washing machines as well as in Advanced Development on dishwasher dry systems.
At Jenesis International I worked on several different projects designing, prototyping and testing LED products.

More information of my current and previous work can be found on the projects page.
