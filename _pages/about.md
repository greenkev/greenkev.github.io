I am a roboticist who is fascinated by planning and control for agile legged robots.
I'm particularly excited about the intersection of RL control for locomotion, model-based trajectory optimization, and whole body compliant interaction with the world.

Professionally, I work as a software engineer at [Agility Robotics](https://agilityrobotics.com/) on locomotion for the Digit robot.
In my role at agility I work on both model-based locomotion motion planning and RL locomotion control policies.
Some of the projects I worked on include leading an effort to rebuild a reduced order model based locomotion motion planner, development of RL step recovery controllers, migration of locomotion control logic into a behavior tree, development of learned general purpose RL locomotion control policies, and bringing up locomotion on two new major hardware revisions on a tight timeline.

I received my Robotics PhD from Oregon State University in 2022, advised by [Dr. Jonathan Hurst](https://mime.oregonstate.edu/people/hurst) and [Dr. Ross L. Hatton](http://www.rosslhatton.com/). 
At Oregon state I was a member of the [Dynamic Robotics Lab](https://mime.oregonstate.edu/research/drl/) where I studied modeling, control and motion planning as applied to legged robots. 
My research generally focused on methods to combine the power of deep learning, observed principles of legged locomotion from biologists and knowledge of the physics of locomotion.

During my undergrad I worked as a research assistant in [Dr. C. David Remy's](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/press/experts/Prof.-Dr.-C.-David-Remy) RAMlab (Robotics and Motion Laboratory) where I worked with RAMone, a series elastic planar biped designed to study efficient locomotion.

I also worked as a research assistant in a lab group lead by [Dr. Glenn Green, M.D.,](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/otolaryngology/glenn-e-green-md) and [Dr. David Zopf, M.D.,](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/otolaryngology/david-zopf-md-ms) in the University of Michigan Medical School's Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.
In this research I primarily worked on creation of patient specific surgical reference models and high fidelity surgical training models for pediatric procedures. 
Some of the models I contributed to are now sold through a University of Michigan startup, [Make Medical](https://www.makemedical.net/).

I am originally from Saint Joseph, Michigan. 
I received my B.S.E in Mechanical Engineering, Summa Cum Laude, from the University of Michigan in 2017.
Outside of academic research labs, I interned at Whirlpool Corp. and [Jenesis International](https://www.jenesisinc.com/).
At Whirlpool I worked in Computer-Aided Engineering performing test analysis and model correlation on vertical axis washing machines as well as in Advanced Development on dishwasher dry systems.
At Jenesis International I worked on several different projects designing, prototyping and testing LED products.

More information of my current and previous work can be found on the professional projects page.

Outside of work I really enjoy woodworking, weight lifting, attending concerts, cooking, watching and attending sports, camping, and playing a variety of video games (e.g. Elden Ring, Fallout, Factorio).
