I am a PhD student in Robotics at Oregon State University, advised by [Jonathan Hurst](https://mime.oregonstate.edu/people/hurst) and [Ross L. Hatton](http://www.rosslhatton.com/). 
I am a member of the [Dynamic Robotics Lab](https://mime.oregonstate.edu/research/drl/) where I study modeling, control and motion planning as applied to legged robots. My research generally focuses on robust and agile bipedal locomotion, particularly applied to Agility Robotics' Cassie Robot.
I am currently working on methods that combine the power of deep learning, observed principles of legged locomotion from biologists and knowledge of the physics of locomotion.

During my undergrad I worked as a research assistant in [C. David Remy's](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/press/experts/Prof.-Dr.-C.-David-Remy) RAMlab (Robotics and Motion Laboratory) where I worked with RAMone, a series elastic planar biped designed to study efficient locomotion.

I also worked as a research assistant in a lab group lead by [Glenn Green](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/otolaryngology/glenn-e-green-md) and [David Zopf](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/otolaryngology/david-zopf-md-ms) in the University of Michigan Medical School's Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.
In this research I primarily worked on creation of patient specific surgical reference models and high fidelity surgical training models for pediatric procedures. 
Some of the models I contributed to are now sold through a University of Michigan startup, [Make Medical](https://www.makemedical.net/).

I am originally from Saint Joseph, Michigan. 
I received my B.S.E in Mechanical Engineering, Summa Cum Laude, from the University of Michigan in 2017.
Outside of academic research labs, I interned at Whirlpool Corp. and [Jenesis International](https://www.jenesisinc.com/).
At Whirlpool I worked in Computer-Aided Engineering performing test analysis and model correlation on vertical axis washing machines as well as in Advanced Development on dishwasher dry systems.
At Jenesis International I worked on several different projects designing, prototyping and testing LED products.

More information of my current and previous work can be found on the projects page.
