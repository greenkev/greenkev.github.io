    abstract = "Introduction Laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR) with cartilage graft augmentation is an effective treatment for subglottic stenosis and a critical advanced procedure for Pediatric Otolaryngologists. Trainees almost exclusively learn this procedure intraoperatively on children due to the lack of adequate pediatric training models. An enhanced and accelerated educational experience may be possible if trainees can rehearse the key portions of the procedure on a simulation model. Objective To design and manufacture a low-cost, high fidelity surgical simulation model of subglottic stenosis for LTR. Methods This simulator is composed of two component models: rib cartilage and trachea. Additive manufacturing techniques, including Computer Aided Design and Three Dimensional (3D) printing, were utilized to create the simulator. Three expert Pediatric Otolaryngologists rated the functionality and realism of the simulator using Likert scale survey data. Results The use of CAD and 3D printing techniques allowed for realistic, reproducible surgical simulation of key aspects of LTR. The validation evidence indicated good to excellent means across the five domains relevant to the simulator's fidelity and usability (M = 3.47 to 4.00) out of a maximum of 4 points. Lowest rated items were consistent with expert comments suggesting minor simulator improvements. Time of production is approximately 20 h from print to post-processing, and consumable material costs per model are $2.60 USD. Conclusions This subglottic stenosis airway simulator facilitated Laryngotracheal Reconstruction rehearsal and is a promising training tool for pediatric otolaryngologists. Our methods allow patient-specific, pre-surgical rehearsal for complex airway scenarios that could benefit the experienced airway surgeon and trainees alike. Future research aims to validate this device's utility for accelerating attainment of proficiency and improving surgical outcomes."
