    abstract = "{Surgical simulators have the potential to support safe, standardized, competency-based surgical education. For training in cleft lip repair, adult cadaveric simulators lack accurate representation of this predominately pediatric procedure. Cleft lip repair educational devices are almost exclusively virtual reality based, using computer graphics with real-time haptic feedback. Only 1 physical model that lacks validation for surgical rehearsal exists in the literature. This study proposes and evaluates a cleft lip repair simulator for trainee education.}",
